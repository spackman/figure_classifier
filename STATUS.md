Current status:  
  
Working on getting sphinx autodocumentation to work. Currently I'm having issues with apidoc not detecting and properly generating docs for my functions.  
  
Need to correct this and ultimately incorporate building the docs (and tests of the build?) into a github action CI process similar to https://youtu.be/kiUNFD6hcJM?feature=shared.  
  
Need to configure precommit with github actions to properly check the code.  
  
Progress:  
  Had first successful deployment to readthedocs website  
  Successfully published template package on pypi  
  Successfully configured pytest and nox   
  Established code structure   
  
Next:  
  Fix precommit  
  Write + get code working  
  Then revisit documentation issues
