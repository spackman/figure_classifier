ABSTRACT: Quaternary distance restraints are essential to deﬁne the three-dimensional structures of protein assemblies. These distances often fall within a range of 10−18 Å, which challenges the high and low measurement limits of conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and double electron−electron resonance electron spin resonance spectroscopies. Here, we report the use of 19F paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR in combination with 19F/paramagnetic labeling to equivalent sites in diﬀerent subunits of a protein complex in micelles to determine intersubunit distances. The feasibility of this strategy was evaluated on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, for which we found excellent agreement of the 19F PRE NMR results with previous structural information. The study suggests that 19F PRE NMR is a viable tool in extracting distance restraints to deﬁne quaternary structures.

D espite great success in the use of X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of various ion channels, the capacity of these techniques to solve the structure of ﬂexible protein regions is often challenged. Double electron−electron resonance (DEER) electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has proven to be useful for measuring quaternary structural restraints without restrictions from the local dynamic properties of ion channels.1−5 However, for membrane proteins, DEER ESR can measure distances typically in the range of 18− 60 Å and is unreliable for measuring shorter distances.6
Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been developed for extracting distance restraints of 13−25 Å between an NMR observable nucleus and a paramagnetic probe,7−9 which is often introduced by nitroxide spin labeling of a single cysteine that exists either naturally or is introduced by mutagenesis.10 The paramagnetic MTSL [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-D3pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate], commonly used for ESR studies, has been adopted for PRE NMR measurements. The unpaired electron spins of MTSL enhance nuclear longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates in a distance-dependent manner. The paramagnetic enhancement

of R2 in the r−6 distance dependency for NMR nuclei within the range of 13−25 Å7 can be quantiﬁed to extract distance information. The distances resulting from PRE measurements complement short interproton distance restraints (≤5 Å) derived from the nuclear Overhauser eﬀect (NOE), as well as longer distance restraints measured by DEER ESR. Another beneﬁt of PRE NMR is that it can be used to gather structural information not only for well-folded proteins but also for disordered proteins.11 Additionally, paramagnetic probes decrease the spin−lattice relaxation time and speed up NMR data acquisition.9 Thus, PRE NMR has become an invaluable tool in structure biology.
PRE experiments are commonly performed by monitoring 1H signal changes in 1H−15N NMR spectra due to the MTSLinduced R2 enhancement.7,8,12,13 19F PRE NMR,14,15 however, has received recent attention, especially when larger proteins and protein complexes are under investigation. In general, 19F NMR is a valued addition to other structural approaches used

for characterizing structures and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes, including ion channels.3,16−18 A null 19F
signal background in native biological systems prevents signal overlap, which occurs in 1H−15N spectra of large proteins and
often compromises accurate measurements of PRE from individual sites. The excellent sensitivity of 19F resulting from
its 100% natural abundance and high gyromagnetic ratio adds another advantage for using 19F PRE NMR in structure
determinations. In the present work, we have created a 19F/MTSL labeling
scheme for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs)
that allows us to determine intersubunit distances by solution 19F PRE NMR. This new strategy for gaining quaternary
structural information can be easily extended to other proteins
and protein complexes beyond pLGICs. A key step in acquiring this quaternary structural information via 19F PRE NMR is to label both the 19F and paramagnetic probes to
selected equivalent residues in a channel complex. In our experiments, the 19F probe TET [2,2,2-triﬂuoroethanethiol] that provides a triﬂuoromethyl (−CH2CF3) was tagged to a selected cysteine in a channel protein as reported previously.3
The paramagnetic probe MTSL was also labeled to cysteine
sites equivalent to that tagged by TET. For pLGICs, a labeling molar ratio of 1 TET:4 MTSL (where one of the ﬁve subunits
is labeled with TET and the remaining four subunits are labeled with MTSL) is ideal for 19F PRE NMR to extract
distances between adjacent subunits. To achieve a proper
TET:MTSL labeling ratio, we tested various conditions,
including the order of labeling and labeling times for each species. TET has a much lower labeling eﬃciency than MTSL.3 Thus, it was crucial to use an excess amount of TET
as compared with MTSL. It is also important to control the
total labeling time (see additional details in the Experimental Methods). The ﬁnal labeling eﬃciencies of TET and MTSL were conﬁrmed with respective 19F NMR and ESR,3 showing ∼15% TET and ∼67% MTSL labeling (approximately 1:4 molar ratio) in each sample. Such labeling eﬃciencies ensure a suﬃciently high probability of each 19F TET-labeled residue to
meet at least one paramagnetic center at the equivalent residue
labeled with MTSL in an adjacent subunit so that a quaternary distance restraint can be measured from 19F PRE NMR
experiments. We ﬁrst examined the feasibility of this new strategy using
ELIC (Figure 1a), a homomeric prokaryotic pLGIC with known X-ray structures.19,20 In addition to the X-ray structures, DEER ESR and 19F NMR experiments were also previously performed on the ELIC L253C mutant.3 The variety of
available structural information makes the ELIC L253C construct an ideal candidate to evaluate the 19F PRE NMR
strategy. Moreover, neither the TET nor the MTSL tags at L253C aﬀect the ion channel function of ELIC.3 Residue 253
in each ELIC subunit is located at the interface of the
extracellular and transmembrane domains (Figure 1a, PDB code: 3RQU20). The distance between two L253 Cβ atoms in the adjacent subunits is 15.3 ± 0.06 Å (mean ± standard
deviation) (Figure 1b), which falls into the measurable distance range of 19F PRE NMR.14,15 In order to know how
well the distances measured through the TET and/or MTSL tags in 19F PRE NMR or DEER ESR match with the Cβ
distances in the X-ray structure, we modeled conformational
ensembles of MTSL labels at residue 253 in the ELIC X-ray structure using MTSSLWizard software.21 The calculated
distances between the paramagnetic centers of MTSL in the

(b) Distances obtained from 19F PRE NMR and DEER ESR experiments are compared to distances between L253 Cβ atoms (Cβ-Cβ) in adjacent subunits of the structure shown in (a). Additional comparisons include the distances between the paramagnetic center of MTSL tags (MTSL-MTSL) or the average TET ﬂuorine positions (TET-MTSL), based on the modeled conformational ensembles of MTSL-MTSL and TET-MTSL labels in adjacent subunits of the ELIC X-ray structure using MTSSLWizard software.21 Error bars represent standard deviation for all measured distances.

adjacent subunits (18.2 ± 5.6 Å) were in excellent agreement with the experimental distance (18.5 ± 3.9 Å) measured by DEER ESR.3 Similar MTSSLWizard calculations for TETMTSL pairs of the adjacent residues 253 in the ELIC X-ray structure show a distance distribution (17.4 ± 4.4 Å) that also matches well with the distance derived from 19F PRE NMR described as follows.
19F PRE NMR spectra of ELIC L253C labeled with TET and MTSL were collected with varied relaxation delays under paramagnetic (para) and diamagnetic (dia, after addition of ascorbic acid to the same sample) conditions (Figure 1c). The protein was solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM), which was used previously for ELIC crystal structures.19,20 The corresponding resonance intensities (Ipara, Idia) as a function of relaxation times were ﬁt to exponential decay functions to derive their respective transverse relaxation rates. The data collected in the paramagnetic state were ﬁt to single, double, and triple exponential decay functions to test whether more than one R2para relaxation component existed in the sample. However, like R2dia, only the single exponential decay function could ﬁt data to generate R2para (R2para = 1153 ± 194 Hz, R2dia

where r is the distance between the 19F nucleus and the paramagnetic center, ωF is the 19F Larmor frequency (564.68 MHz) times 2π, τc is the correlation time for the nuclear− electron interaction that can be assumed to be equal to the global correlation time of the protein,8 which was estimated as 218 ns at 10 °C (see Supporting Information) using Stokes’ law.23 The constants in the above equation include the permeability constant μ0, the ﬂuorine gyromagnetic ratio γF, the electron g-factor g, the Bohr magneton μB, and the electron spin quantum number S (S = 1/2) of a nitroxide radical. N is the number of the paramagnetic centers adjacent to the 19F nucleus. Typically, only one paramagnetic center (N = 1) is present for a chosen nucleus.7,8,12−15 However, because of the
5-fold symmetry of homopentameric channels and the 1
TET:4 MTSL labeling scheme, the probability to have two equivalent paramagnetic centers (N = 2) in the two adjacent subunits for each 19F nucleus is extremely high. Thus, we used
the equation above to obtain an adjacent intersubunit distance of 18.4 ± 1.7 Å for the case of N = 2. This distance is close to
the predicted distance for modeled MTSL-TET pairs in
adjacent ELIC subunits in the X-ray structure (Figure 1b).
Small distance discrepancies from three experimental methods
are expected because the intersubunit distance was measured using diﬀerent reference points: Cβ atoms of two adjacent

L253 residues in the X-ray structure, between two adjacent MTSL paramagnetic centers in DEER ESR, or between the 19F
nucleus of the labeled TET and the MTSL paramagnetic center of the adjacent subunit in 19F PRE NMR.
The 1 TET:4 MTSL labeling scheme ensures a uniform 19F
PRE signal from the adjacent paramagnetic MTSL labels.
However, to what degree does a nonadjacent MTSL interfere
with the intended measurement for distances between adjacent subunits? The distances shown in crystal structures19,20 and the DEER ESR results (18.5 ± 3.9 Å and 31.0 ± 5.6 Å for adjacent and nonadjacent residues 253, respectively)3 are consistent
with the geometric arrangement of a pentamer, which has a
distance ratio of 1.62 between equivalent residues in
nonadjacent vs adjacent subunits. A steep decay of PRE with increasing distance (r−6) makes the PRE contribution from nonadjacent MTSL almost negligible ((1.62)−6 < 6%). Thus,
the nonadjacent subunit distance in a pentameric channel is
too far to be measured by PRE and the distances extracted from the 19F PRE NMR in conjunction with our 19F/MTSL labeling scheme should predominantly reﬂect only the
distances between adjacent subunits. The same 19F PRE NMR strategy was applied to the human
α7 nAChR, a pentameric neurotransmitter-gated ion channel whose structures are still under investigation,24 especially the structure of its intracellular domain. 19F PRE NMR experi-
ments along with the 1 TET:4 MTSL labeling scheme were
performed on two separate single-cysteine mutants (C435 and C427) of α7 nAChR that are both located in the intracellular domain (Figure 2a). 19F PRE NMR spectra of C435 and C427
in micelles collected under paramagnetic (red) and diamag-
netic (blue) conditions (Figure 2b) provided data to calculate the corresponding transverse relaxation rates R2para and R2dia

(Figure 2c), which allow for subsequent calculations of intersubunit distances at each residue (C435 = 18.3 ± 1.7 Å; C427 = 17.2 ± 1.6 Å). Intersubunit distances at the C435 and
C427 positions are similar to distances at equivalent positions
(A423 and K415, respectively) between two adjacent subunits in the cryo-EM structure (PDB code: 6BE1)25 of the restingstate 5-HT3A receptor, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologous to α7 nAChR (Table 1S, Supporting Information). The distances for both sites in α7 nAChR are shorter
than or close to the borderline of the low distance limit of DEER ESR measurements,6 demonstrating the value of 19F
PRE NMR as a complementary tool in quaternary structure
determination. Although the disulﬁde-linked labels, such as MTSL and
TET, have been widely used in ESR and NMR experiments, it
is reasonable to question whether these labels introduce errors
to the derived distances. Indeed, one should be cautious when
choosing a labeling site to avoid structural disturbance to
proteins. If permitted, a functionality assessment should be arranged after labeling.3,18 Battiste and Wagner previously
showed good agreements between PRE-derived distances with an error bound of ±4 Å and the corresponding distances in a known protein structure.7 Gottstein et al. also investigated the eﬀect of the error margin for PRE-derived distances and found that the ﬁnal structure quality was largely insensitive to the size of the error bound.26 Structures with a backbone RMSD of 1.0−1.6 Å to the reference structure were obtained even with PRE error bounds up to 10 Å.26 Thus, an error bound of ±4 Å
for PRE-based distance restraints should ensure the structural
accuracy, especially when a large number of restraints are
collected from sites evenly distributed throughout the protein. Although proteins in micelles were used in the current study,
the reported method can be applied to proteins in other
membrane mimics, such as nanodiscs and bicelles. The choice
of membrane mimics is often determined by the protein
stability and quality of NMR spectra. In most cases, membrane proteins are puriﬁed in detergent. Thus, one can complete the labeling procedures in detergent and then move the labeled
protein into another mimetic membrane if it is more suitable
for the protein. Orthogonal spin labels with diﬀerent spectroscopic proper-
ties have created new platforms in ESR and NMR studies of biomacromolecules with the beneﬁt of increasing information content of experimental results.27,28 Exploiting paramagnetic
probes other than nitroxide (such as chelators of Gd(III) and
other lanthanide ions) in combination with labeling to
noncysteine residues (i.e., unnatural amino acids incorporated
into proteins) have demonstrated great potential in various applications.27,28 All of these options can be integrated into our
reported method for extracting structural information on ion channels. For example, a 19F probe can be introduced biosynthetically in protein expression16 instead of chemical modiﬁcation as shown in the current study. This may become more relevant if labeling of membrane-embedded cysteine is problematic. Click chemistry, which oﬀers a fast and highly
selective biocompatible reaction between azide and alkyne
groups, is a good option to tag paramagnetic probes, for which
unnatural amino acids can be introduced to desired sites in the protein.28 Furthermore, one has the freedom to choose whether 19F probe and paramagnetic tags are in equivalent or nonequivalent positions among diﬀerent channel subunits. The ﬁnal choice will be determined by protein performance in
structural and functional experiments.

In conclusion, 19F PRE NMR in combination with the TET/
MTSL labeling scheme presented here is a realistic alternative
approach for generating quaternary distance restraints for ion channels and other protein complexes that may be diﬃcult to be deﬁned by a diﬀerent structural tool.
■ EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Sample Preparations. ELIC was expressed and puriﬁed as reported previously.3,20,29 The single cysteine ELIC L253C3 was
constructed after replacing native C300 and C313 to alanine and
serine, respectively, using the QuickChange Lightning Kit for single or multisite mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). Single-cysteine α7
nAChR constructs (C427 and C435) containing the transmembrane
domain (TMD) and intracellular domain (ICD) were prepared on the basis of the full-length WT α7 nAChR construct24 by replacing
native cysteines in the TMD and ICD with alanine or serine. Each
construct was transformed to Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) cells for expression in Luria−Bertani media or in the 15NH4Cl-containing M9 media. The expression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside when OD reached ∼0.8. The expression at 15 °C lasted ∼24 h for ELIC or ∼72 h for the α7 nAChR TMD+ICD. Harvested cells were resuspended in a buﬀer (50 mM sodium
phosphate at pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitors for ELIC and 50 mM Tris at pH 8, 150 mM NaCl for α7) and lysed using a M110Y microﬂuidizer processor (Microﬂuidics). The cell membrane
was pelleted by ultracentrifugation. ELIC fused with maltose binding protein was extracted with 2% (w/v) DDM (Anatrace) and puriﬁed
with a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). Maltose binding protein was cleaved oﬀ overnight using protease HRV3C (GE
Healthcare) and separated from ELIC using HisTrap HP columns. The pentameric ELIC was collected in a buﬀer containing 25 mM
sodium phosphate at pH 8, 125 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) DDM by
size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The single-cysteine α7 nAChR TMD+ICD was extracted with 2.5% (w/v) LDAO (N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide, Sigma) and puriﬁed with 0.4% (w/v) LDAO using a
HisTrap HP column and subsequently a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column as used in ELIC puriﬁcations.
Several steps are involved in the labeling of α7 nAChR and ELIC with TET/MTSL (Toronto Research Chemicals). A given puriﬁed protein was ﬁrst treated brieﬂy (∼1 h) with the reducing reagent DTT (Invitrogen) (∼15× the protein concentration) at RT to prepare all
available cysteines for labeling. After removing DTT with HiTrap
Desalting columns (GE Healthcare), a 25-fold molar excess of MTSL was added to the protein and mixed with the sample for ∼30 s.
Immediately after, we added a 100-fold molar excess of TET to the protein, considering that TET is more diﬃcult to be labeled than MTSL.3 A faster leaving group (the sulﬁnic acid, CH3SO2H) in the MTSL labeling process and suppressed sulfhydryl ionization that is
due to a hydrophobic environment in the TET labeling sites may have contributed to their diﬀerent labeling eﬃciencies in the channel
proteins. The sample was placed on an inversion mixer and incubated for 3 h at RT and then overnight at 4 °C. Free MTSL and TET were removed by dialysis with three changes of buﬀer and then subjected to
size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. The labeling eﬃciencies of TET and MTSL were assessed by 19F NMR and ESR, respectively.3
A typical sample for 19F PRE NMR contained ∼100 μM protein, 20 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer at pH 7.7, 120 mM NaCl, and 0.5% (w/v) DDM for ELIC or 0.5−1.0% (w/v) LDAO for α7 nAChR, equivalent to a molar ratio (detergent to protein) of ∼100 for ELIC and ∼200 for α7 TMD-ICD. 5% D2O was added for deuterium lock. The diamagnetic condition for TET/MTSL-labeled samples in 19F
PRE NMR was achieved by adding a 10-fold molar excess of ascorbic acid. To determine the global rotational correlation time (τc) of the α7 nAChR TMD+ICD by 1D [15N−1H]-TRACT NMR experiment,30 a sample containing 15N-labeled α7 nAChR TMD+ICD, 5 mM sodium acetate buﬀer at pH 5.0, 25 mM NaCl, and 1.0% LDAO
was used.

NMR Data Collection and Analysis. 19F PRE NMR was performed at 10 °C on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer (19F frequency: 564.68 MHz) equipped with a triple-resonance 19Fdetection TXO cryoprobe (Bruker Instruments). Spectra to measure the 19F transverse relaxation rates (R2) were collected using the Carr− Purcell−Meiboom−Gill pulse sequence (CPMG) with 8192 data points, a 30-ppm spectral width, and a carrier frequency at −70 ppm. For each sample, spectra were collected in the absence and presence of ascorbic acid, corresponding to paramagnetic and diamagnetic conditions, respectively, with varied relaxation delays of 0.244, 0.488, 0.732, 1.22, 1.952, 4.148, and 9.76 ms and a recycle delay of 1 s. Each sample requires 24 to 30 h for NMR data collection and 9600 to 12 000 scans for each spectrum at a given relaxation delay time. The 19F chemical shift was externally referenced to the trichloroﬂuoro-
methane resonance at 0.0 ppm. The NMR spectra were acquired, processed, and analyzed with
TopSpin 3.5 (Bruker Instruments). 19F transverse relaxation rates of R2para and R2dia were obtained in the absence and presence of ascorbic acid, respectively, from ﬁtting the 19F peak intensity (I) as a function of the relaxation delay in a single exponential decay function. The 19F PRE, Γ2F = R2para − R2dia, was calculated and used in the Solomon− Bloembergen equation22 to obtain the distance between the 19F nucleus of TET in one subunit and the paramagnetic center of MTSL in the adjacent subunit.
To determine a rotational correlation time (τc) for the α7 nAChR TMD+ICD, a series of 1D [15N−1H]-TRACT NMR spectra30 with varied relaxation periods of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 ms were acquired with a recycle time of 1 s at 45 °C on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance inverse-detection cryoprobe TCI (Bruker Instruments).
